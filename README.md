# World Weather Analysis
## Overview
This analysis looks at different weather patterns around the global and offers insights to travelers who want to book a trip. There are three folders here that offer different levels of analysis: weather database, vacation search, and vacation itinerary.

### Weather Database
This first folder uses the Open Weather Map API to pull weather information from many countries around the world. That information consists of:

1.  Maximum Temperature
2.  Cloudiness
3.  Wind Speed
4.  Humidity
5.  Current Weather Description

Using this information can greatly help travelers find there way on where they would like to visit.

### Vacation Search
This folder takes the information gained in the weather database and uses the Google Maps API to create different travel plans across various locations. The locations are found through a user input of the minimum and maximum temperature of the location that one would like to visit.



### Vacation Itinerary
This folder takes the information from the search folder and uses the Google Maps directions API to create a vacation itinerary. This itinerary takes in a starting city, end city, as well as multiple stop locations, whether for supplies or visiting for attractions.
